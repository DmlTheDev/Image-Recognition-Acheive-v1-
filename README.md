# Image-Recognition-Acheive-v1-
Image Recognition program for the education website achieve.hashtag-learning.co.uk where i designed and developed a image recognition system / program that will automaticly start a new test for you and work its way though it , without ecessive amounts of errors although all the answers will be correct 99.89% of the time. The program works though the build in pyautogui using the mouse position to move the mouse to a x,y coordinates where it can also type in the needed answer if nessasery. 

Minor errors conclude of: When the streak gets to 1,000 the webpage strechs to fit the new high streak causing the x,y coordinates change but this is a simple fix! 

note:
     (This is only version 1 of the program and there is more to come. I will be working with image recognition in my up and coming programs / games so look forward to that!!)
